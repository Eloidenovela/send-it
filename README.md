# send-it

This project implements a file transfer system using the RPC library, developed in C++. The goal is to provide a lightweight and efficient solution for transmitting files between devices on a local network.

## Features

- **File Sending and Receiving**: Allows the transfer of files of any format and size.
- **Performance and Efficiency**: Leverages the advantages of RPC for fast and efficient transfers, with an optimized implementation in C++.
- **Simple Interface**: Provides an intuitive command-line interface for easy use and configuration.

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- Standard C++ libraries
- `rpclib` installed in your machine
- Compatible operating system (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- So, I recommend that you have __xmake__ installed in your machine, that way you don't need to download anything, __xmake__ will do it for you.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Eloidenovela/send-it.git`
2. Compile the project using a compatible C++ compiler.
3. Run the program, specifying the mode (client or server) and necessary parameters, such as IP address and port.
